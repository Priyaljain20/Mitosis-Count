# Mitosis-Count
## cyclegan_mitosis.ipynb
### Here our aim is to convert low intensity images of mitosis count to high intensity images (i.e kmit-mitosis(256x256) quality to icpr-mitosis(512x512) quality).
### cyclegan_mitosis.ipynb contains code in which for now the dataset is horse2zebra where horse size is 256 * 256 and zebra size is 512 to 512 later they can be replaced with *horse -> kmit(256x256)* and *zebra -> icpr(512x512)* .
### In this code now I'm able to run code without any errors but it is slow.
### Changes have to be done accordingly.
